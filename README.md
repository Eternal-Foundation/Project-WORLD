# Project-WORLD

## Project Overview
---
Project-WORLD  is an ambitious venture aiming to create a multifaceted virtual world encompassing both social networking and gaming elements, all within a decentralized, community-governed framework.

This project is divided into two components:
- A locally Simulated and community-governed Virtual world, Via Internet and Mesh network And Blockchain.
- A worldwide Virtual Network.


## Vision and Goals
---
The vision for Project-WORLD  is to foster a dynamic and immersive virtual space where participants can engage in a variety of activities, ranging from social interactions to gaming adventures.

By prioritizing local communities and empowering them to govern the virtual environment, the project aims to create a sense of ownership and belonging among users.

Key goals include Education On Computer Science Along With promoting sustainability through recycling initiatives, integrating blockchain technology for asset management, and fostering creativity through customizable programming languages and game mechanics.
